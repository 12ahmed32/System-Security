Assembler :
An assembler is a program that translates the assembly language to the machine code
There are several different assemblers that depends on the target systems'ISA :
Microsoft Macro Assembler [MASM] -> x86 assembler that uses the intel syntax for MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows
GNU Assembler [GAS] -> used by the GNU project , default backend of GCC
Netwide Assembler [NASM] -> x86 architecture used to write 16-bit , 32-bit(IA-32) and 64-bit(x86-64) programs , one of the most popular assemblers for linux
Flat assymbler [FASM] -> x86 supports Intel-style assembly language on the IA-32 and x86-64
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
source code file -> [assembled] -> object file . it is a binary represntation of the program 
while the assembly instructions and the machine code have a one-to-one correspoindence and the translation process may be simlpe
the assembly does some further operations such as : 
assigining memory locations to variables and instructions and resolving symbolic names
----------------------------------------------------
once the assembler has created the object file  , a linker is needed in order to create the actual executable file .
what a linker does is take one or more object files and combine them to create the executable file
an examble of these object files are the kernel32.dll and user32.dll which are required to crearte a windows executable that accesses ceratin libraries
